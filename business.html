          <h2>About Business </h2>
          <p>
            As a matter of fact, it is very important for JHS candidates to understand the various subjects combination under Business and other fields of study in Second Cycle Schools.
Specifically, this guide will concentrate on the area of Business program that is offered in various Senior High Schools in Ghana and across the world.
Now, you may ask  what are the courses under Business which I can study in High School? Let’s find all the answer right below.

          </p>

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>

           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in Business  </h3>
           <h5>1.Financial Accounting </h5>
          <p>
            Financial accounting contains enough accountancy knowledge and skills for Senior High School students for purposes of their end- of-course examination. The syllabus also prepares students towards future career paths in accounting related vocations as well as providing them adequate foundation for pursuing higher professional and academic courses in accounting
            Accountancy education leads to improvement in students‟ numeracy skills and further provides them with background skills for future business studies. Accountancy offers ready employment to students who do well in the subject, thus offering them life long enriching careers such as accountant, auditor, banker, financial analyst, tax consultant, management consultant, accounting lecturers/ teachers etc </p>
          <h5>2.Business Management</h5>
           <p>
            The course in business management will help to develop a business management culture, which is vital for promoting economic development.
            A Business enterprise is an organization for managing resources to satisfy human needs and wants. A healthy economy and an improved standard of living depend on efficient and purposeful management of resources for the production of goods and services. Without an efficient management system, no organization can achieve any meaningful growth to be able to contribute financially and socially to its owner(s), staff and to the nation in general. One of the major goals of Ghana’s economic development is to improve the nation’s management capability towards the enhancement of the standard of living of its people    </p>
          <h5>3.Economics</h5>       
          <p>
            Economics is the practical and theoretical science of the production and distribution of wealth. It is based around the system of the production, buying and selling of goods and services.

            As a social science it is primarily concerned with the behaviour and relationships of people and societies and economics is applied to the real world to study and analyse the activities and interaction between people, markets and governments.
            
            Although there are various subdivisions of economics, the two main areas of study are microeconomics and macroeconomics
            It has grown considerably as a field and now incorporates a number of other subjects, including sociology, geography, law and several others to develop our collective understanding of the economic systems that exist today.    </p>
          <h5>4.Elective Mathematics</h5>   
          <p>
           Elective Mathematics at the Senior High School buils on the Core Mathematics Of Sebior High School.

           It covers most of the topics in A-level mathematics papers from Cambridge though it is a little easier.
           
           On the WASSCE examination papers, it is called Further Mathematics Elective
           These include the skill of working with mathematical information, as well as the ability to think logically and independently, consider accuracy, model situations mathematically, analyse results and reflect on findings.
