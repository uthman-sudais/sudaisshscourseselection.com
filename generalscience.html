          <h2>About General Science </h2>
          <p>
            Science is defined in several meaningful ways. However, as a course in Senior High School, General Science involves the study of the natural phenomenon through a systematic approach of science: hypothesis, experiments, observation, and arriving at some logical conclusions. 

            General Science as a course also involves the study and application of technology (ICT in general).
            
            Depending on each school's capacity, various combinations of the elective subjects are made for students grouped into various classes
          </p>

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>
          <p>
            Core subjects are the subject which are compulsary and common among all the courses being offered in all SHS in Ghana.The core subject are only four namely: 
           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in General Science  </h3>
           <h5>1.Physics</h5>
          <p>
            Physics is often described as the study of matter and energy. It is concerned with how matter and energy relate to each other, and how they affect each other over time and through space. Physicists ask the fundamental questions: How did the universe begin? How and of what is it made? How does it change? What rules govern its behavior
            The study of physics has had and continues to have,a big impact on the world community.The idea,skills and attribute derived from the study of physics are being widely applied in varoius scientific and technological develpment 
             As an example ,development in renewable energy is serving the world profoundly and it is hoped that it will become more available in Ghana to complement other sources for meeting the energy needs of the country.
             The principles and application of physics cut across the varoius spectrum of everyday life activities like walking, lifting, seeing and taking photographs 
          </p>
          <h5>2.Chemistry</h5>
           <p>
            chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes.
            Chemistry also is concerned with the utilization of natural substances and the creation of artificial ones. Cooking, fermentation, glass making, and metallurgy are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization.
            Most of the materials that occur on Earth, such as wood, coal, minerals, or air, are mixtures of many different and distinct chemical substances. Each pure chemical substance (e.g., oxygen, iron, or water) has a characteristic set of properties that gives it its chemical identity.
          </p>
          <h5>3.Biology</h5>       
          <p>
            Biology is a natural science discipline that studies living things. It is a very large and broad field due to the wide variety of life found on Earth, so individual biologists normally focus on specific fields. These fields are either categorized by the scale of life or by the types of organisms studied.
            For example, the scale of biology can cover everything from genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology – studying the molecules of life inside our cells and how they help us function – to cell biology which focuses on the basic unit of life.
            Biology is also a foundation for other biology-based professions such as medicine, nursing and allied health, pharmacy and pharmacology, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.
          </p>
          <h5>4.Elective Mathematics</h5>   
          <p>
           Elective Mathematics at the Senior High School buils on the Core Mathematics Of Sebior High School.
           Elective Maths is done in addition to Core Maths which is required for all students. The goal for teaching the subject is to equip students who would pursue further studies in fields that require additional mathematics with the requisite mathematical knowledge and facility.

           It covers most of the topics in A-level mathematics papers from Cambridge though it is a little easier.
           
           On the WASSCE examination papers, it is called Further Mathematics Elective
           These include the skill of working with mathematical information, as well as the ability to think logically and independently, consider accuracy, model situations mathematically, analyse results and reflect on findings. 
          </p>
          <h5>4.Elective ICT </h5>  
          <p>
            This course is designed to provide advanced skills in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Senior High School (SHS) students. It is expected that the knowledge and skills gained in this course will prepare students to pursue ICT courses in years ahead and provide them with the basic skills needed for the ICT job market. The syllabus covers selected topics in ICT which offer hands-on activities to help students acquire the required ICT skills.
            scope of content This syllabus has been planned at a higher content level than the ICT content at the Core ICT level. This has been done to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the job market and for pursuing further ICT course. The themes of this course are as follows:
Information and Communications Technology Hardware Introduction to software development PC Hardware Maintenance and Software Installation Desktop Publishing Software and its functionality Word Processing Spreadsheet Introduction to Data Processing Systems Introduction to Programming Basic Networking Data Communications Introduction to Educational Technology

            Carrier Opputunites in General Science
          </h3>
          <p>
            Students that excel in Mathematics, Integrated Science, and English Language are more likely to succeed in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).
            After graduating senior high school and receiving a good mark in the general science course, one can gain admission to the University of their choosing, College of Health Sciences, College of Agriculture and Consumer Sciences, and Faculty of Engineering Science.
            A Science Student can work as a Doctor, Nurse, Teacher, Physician, Lab Technician, or Pharmacist. They can also venture into the engineering field and take up electrical, chemical and computer science careers.
            General science students have more significant opportunities
