            An architect is responsible for the design, planning, and supervision of the construction of buildings and other physical structures. They work closely with clients to understand their needs and objectives and create designs that meet their requirements while also adhering to building codes and regulations. Architects may work on a wide range of projects, from designing individual houses to large commercial buildings, public infrastructure, and even entire cityscapes.

In addition to design work, architects are also responsible for overseeing the construction process, working closely with builders, contractors, and other professionals to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. They also need to have a strong understanding of materials and construction methods to ensure that the building is structurally sound and meets safety requirements
Architects must consider a range of factors when designing a building, including the site's location, the client's budget and goals, the building's energy efficiency, and the materials and technologies used.

            Building a house is a complicated process that involves knowledge of architectural design, building codes, zoning regulations and basic construction elements. A residential building contractor oversees the construction of individual houses and multi-unit housing projects.
            A commercial building contractor oversees the construction and remodeling of stores, malls, hotels and other commercial projects. Most building contractors own their own companies and many of them worked in the construction industry before becoming contractors.
            A building contractor finds, solicits bids from and schedules all of the subcontractors that are necessary to complete the project. The new homeowner or business owner contracts with the building contractor, and the building contractor contracts with the subcontractors and suppliers. Contractors typically charge from 10 percent to 20 percent of the total project cost for this service

            Mechanical engineers play an important role in the automotive, aerospace, biotechnology, computer and electronics, automation, and manufacturing industries. They design, develop, build, and test all sorts of mechanical devices, tools, engines and machines.

Mechanical engineers are able to design and manufacture everything from small parts like miniature connectors, to large machine tools like drill presses. They take a product from start to finish, and design for aesthetics, functionality, and durability.

Examples of products that mechanical engineers can design and develop are: transmissions; engine parts; aircraft engines; control systems; prosthetic devices; disk drives; printers; semiconductor tools; sensors; gas turbines; wind turbines; fuel cells; compressors; robots; and machine tools.
Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousands of years around the world. It is perhaps the most diverse of engineering disciplines.

        A welder specializes in joining metal parts together using various welding techniques. Welding is a process that involves melting the edges of two or more metal pieces and fusing them together to form a strong and durable bond. Welders work with a wide range of metals, including steel, aluminum, and stainless steel, and they use different methods such as arc welding, gas welding, and resistance welding, among others.

        The work of a welder requires precision, technical knowledge, and the ability to interpret and understand blueprints, drawings, and welding symbols. Welders use specialized tools and equipment, including welding machines, torches, electrodes, filler metals, and protective gear such as helmets and gloves. Welders are employed in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and oil and gas.
        Welders play an important role in fabricating and repairing metal structures, components, and equipment.

        Computer engineers design, test, implement and maintain computer software and hardware systems. They ensure both the physical hardware components and software programming components work together smoothly for their clients. Some computer engineers specialize in fields like robotics, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, mobile apps and operating systems.
        Computer engineers often code in multiple languages, such as JavaScript, SQL, Python, C++ and HTML. Although it's not necessary to know them all, many engineers are fluent in one or two, especially those that are similar to one another. Typically, a company uses one or two main coding languages, so the required languages may vary based on where you work.
        A computer engineer's job entails identifying a problem, developing a solution, implementing the solution and troubleshooting the result. This requires a detail-oriented and meticulous analysis of each task they complete. Having analytical skills equips computer engineers to review an issue thoroughly to accurately solve the problem.

        A car designer is someone who creates the appearance and functionality of cars, trucks and other vehicles. They typically focus on one of three areas: the inside, outside or color and trim.

Car designers use their creativity to improve on existing design mechanics and meet consumer demands concerning the style and comfort of a vehicle. The types of materials and design techniques they use depend on factors such as the make and model of the car they're designing.
Car designers can focus on a car's interior, exterior or trim and colors. Interior design involves making the inside of a car as comfortable and functional as possible. This process focuses on the driver's and passengers' safety and placement of controls, buttons and gauges. In comparison, those who focus on exterior design create ideas of what the outside of a car should look like, then they turn those ideas into digital formats.
Before you start pursuing an education in car design, consider spending time in a garage or automotive shop so you see how cars are built and how they function
