          <h2>About Visual Art</h2>
          <p>
            The visual arts create works that are primarily visual in nature, such as ceramics, drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, design, crafts, photography, video, film making, and architecture. These definitions should not be taken too strictly as many artistic disciplines (performing arts, conceptual art, textile arts) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types.

With the use of the computer and software, visual arts has extended the set of tools available to students to be more creative. The application of the computer extends the course to cover applied arts such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design, and decorative art.

These subjects are teased out from all the Visual Arts subjects studied at the Senior High School (SHS) level. The rationale is to provide the student of visual art broad based knowledge and skills in the theory and practice of visual art. The theory component of GKA is to broaden the student‟s scope of vocabulary and to equip him/her with the requisite communication skills that would enable him/her to talk knowledgeably in the subject. The practical component has been designed to reinforce the skills that the visual art student learns in the individual elective subjects of study. Collectively, the objective is to predispose the senior high school student to develop love for the appreciation of the cultural and aesthetic values of Ghanaian arts. Love for the cultural and aesthetic values has the capacity to reinforce the development of the affective domains of learning and to encourage development of patriotism, national pride and self esteem in students.

           
          </p>
          <h5>10.Cremics</h5>
          <p>
            Ceramic objects are made by combining naturally occurring raw materials, such as clay, earthen minerals, and water, and shaping them into forms using handbuilding, wheel-throwing, or mold casting techniques. Once shaped, the object is fired in a kiln at a high temperature. Firing ceramics make them hardened and heat resistant. Ceramic objects are used as building materials, functional dinnerware, decorative sculpture, and more.

            “Ceramic” can be used as an adjective, or as a noun to describe the clay object once it has been fired. There are a number of techniques used in ceramics, depending on the final project you have in mind. Ceramic objects can be built by hand using slab, coiling, and pinching techniques. Potters also use wheel throwing to create symmetrical pottery and slip casting to create multiples of one object.
