          <h2>About General Art </h2>
          <p>
            The General Arts Programme offered in most senior high schools in Ghana is undoubtedly the most offered programme at the secondary level. It is a designed programme that involves the study of Literature In English, French, Economics , Geography, History, Government, Christian Religuos Studies , Twi etc.
            General Arts as a programme also involves the study and application of technology (ICT in general) and Physical Education (PE)
            Depending on each schoolâ€™s capacity, various combinations of the elective subjects are made for students grouped into various classes. For example, in some schools, Hausa is part of General Arts electives
          </p>

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>
          <p>
            Core subjects are the subject which are compulsary and common among all the courses being offered in all SHS in Ghana.The core subject are only four namely: 
           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in General Art  </h3>
           <h5>1.Englisl Literature </h5>
          <p>
            English Literature thus promotes in the individual, the ability to appreciate any literary work set in prose, drama and poetry. The subject encourages the desire and love for reading for pleasure and knowledge. This love for reading directly leads to the enhancement of our competency in the use of the English language.
            Literature helps in our understanding of human nature and how we respond to the challenges of life given different cultural backgrounds. The subject provides a variety of responses to human challenges and therefore helps to increase our appreciation of life through the literary texts we read in different genres, periods and cultures. The knowledge and experiences gained in the study of the subject helps us deal with our own varied human probl
          </p>
          <h5>2.Geography</h5>
           <p>
            The value of geography lies in helping people to understand and adapt to the dynamics of the environment in which they live. The study of geography therefore enables us to understand geographic facts without which it becomes impossible to acquire intimate knowledge of the environment we have to utilize toward our development.
            Geography studies the inter-relationships of the individual, physical and social environments both in spatial (relating to geographic space) and temporal (historical times) terms. Issues of the environment are becoming increasingly important and geography, which studies the environment as a system, can and does provide solutions to environmental problems. Geography thus has a vital contribution to make towards the purpose of education, i.e., solving societal problems and further providing the critical foundation knowledge in the development of Ghana
          </p>
          <h5>3.Economics</h5>       
          <p>
            Economics is the practical and theoretical science of the production and distribution of wealth. It is based around the system of the production, buying and selling of goods and services.

            As a social science it is primarily concerned with the behaviour and relationships of people and societies and economics is applied to the real world to study and analyse the activities and interaction between people, markets and governments.
            
            Although there are various subdivisions of economics, the two main areas of study are microeconomics and macroeconomics
            It has grown considerably as a field and now incorporates a number of other subjects, including sociology, geography, law and several others to develop our collective understanding of the economic systems that exist today.    </p>
          <h5>4.Elective Mathematics</h5>   
          <p>
           Elective Mathematics at the Senior High School buils on the Core Mathematics Of Sebior High School.
           Elective Maths is done in addition to Core Maths which is required for all students. The goal for teaching the subject is to equip students who would pursue further studies in fields that require additional mathematics with the requisite mathematical knowledge and facility.

           It covers most of the topics in A-level mathematics papers from Cambridge though it is a little easier.
           
           On the WASSCE examination papers, it is called Further Mathematics Elective
           These include the skill of working with mathematical information, as well as the ability to think logically and independently, consider accuracy, model situations mathematically, analyse results and reflect on findings. 
          </p>
          <h5>5.Elective ICT </h5>  
          <p>
            This course is designed to provide advanced skills in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Senior High School (SHS) students. It is expected that the knowledge and skills gained in this course will prepare students to pursue ICT courses in years ahead and provide them with the basic skills needed for the ICT job market. The syllabus covers selected topics in ICT which offer hands-on activities to help students acquire the required ICT skills.
            scope of content This syllabus has been planned at a higher content level than the ICT content at the Core ICT level. This has been done to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the job market and for pursuing further ICT course. The themes of this course are as follows:
Information and Communications Technology Hardware Introduction to software development PC Hardware Maintenance and Software Installation Desktop Publishing Software and its functionality Word Processing Spreadsheet Introduction to Data Processing Systems Introduction to Programming Basic Networking Data Communications Introduction to Educational Technology

          </p>
          <h5>6.History </h5>  
          <p>
            This course is designed in line with the New Educational Reforms which seek to make education accessible to all and relevant to the needs of the Ghanaian Society. It offers an opportunity for the student to appreciate the achievements of his/her ancestors and thus develop pride in being a Ghanaian and an African. It hence, challenges the student to show loyalty to the country and always seek to build on what their ancestors have achieved.
            History is the study of the past to help us understand our present situation so that we can build a better future. At the Senior High School (SHS) level, History
should not be seen as memorizing historical facts and dates, but should be presented in a way that shows its relevance for the development of the Nation. For
example, through the achievements of others in the past, the student can become patriotic, be able to know` and take pride in his or her own heritage and be
motivated to build on it.
          </p>
          <h5>7.Government </h5>  
          <p>
            Government refers to the study of the dynamics of politics, the structure of the state and its processes and the relationship between the ruler and the ruled. The subject helps citizens to understand and participate meaningfully in the government and politics of the state. In modern times, government affects the life of every citizen in diverse but significant ways. Citizens therefore need the type of education that will encourage them for popular participation in government and politics to be able to influence government decision-making toward promoting the collective well-being of society. To achieve this, the student requires a form of education that will raise the level of their political consciousness and civic responsibility. Such an education should include knowledge of the nature of government and politics in general, as well as an understanding of the past and present forms and processes of government and politics of this country
          </p>
          <h5>8.French </h5>  
          <p>
            The pace of development in the present world makes it important that we acquire more knowledge in a variety of subjects and also develop the capacity to communicate in more than one language. Some major international languages at the moment are English, French and Spanish. Being able to communicate in at least two of these languages has strategic importance in such areas as Commerce and Industry, Science and Technology, Telecommunication, Diplomacy, Management, etc. Besides, the current trend towards international co-operation, peaceful co-existence and technology transfer, necessitates that a person be able to communicate in a language that is understood by his/her neighbours. Given the geographical position of Ghana, surrounded as it is by French speaking countries, the ability of the Ghanaian to communicate effectively in French will promote, as well as strengthen, socio-economic and political interaction with our neighbours in particular and indeed with other French-speaking countries in general
