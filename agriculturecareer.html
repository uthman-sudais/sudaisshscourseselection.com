            Biologists study humans, plants, animals, and the environments in which they live. They may conduct their studies--human medical research, plant research, animal research, environmental system research--at the cellular level or the ecosystem level or anywhere in between. Biologists are students of the world, interested in learning from every facet of life. Although this scope may seem overwhelming, in practice, biologists specialize in discrete areas that they feel drawn to. Biologists’ daily activities are driven by their area of specialization. Marine biologists study marine populations and physiology, working off boats, at oceanography centers, at aquariums, and at a variety of coastal sites. Biochemists spend most of their day in a laboratory analyzing tissue samples and designing and carrying out research projects to test new hypotheses. Agricultural scientists analyze crop yields produced from different soils, fertilizers, or chemicals. Biologists study life to uncover its secrets and to find ways to solve problems, such as finding a cure for a disease.

          Chemists investigate the properties of matter at the level of atoms and molecules. They measure proportions and reaction rates in order to understand unfamiliar substances and how they behave, or to create new compounds for use in a variety of practical applications. To do this they use a wide range of analytical techniques and instrumentation, including chromatography and spectroscopy.
          Chemists typically specialise in biochemistry, neurochemistry, nuclear chemistry or theoretical chemistry. In the pharmaceutical industry chemists develop drugs and study their properties in order to determine the quality and stability of medicines. Some chemists even work in forensic science to establish evidence in criminal investigations. Experienced chemists are also involved in preparing documentation for product licences.

        An agricultural engineer helps to make farming sustainable, safe, and environmentally friendly. How? By analyzing agricultural operations and looking at new technologies and ways of doing things to improve land use, increase yields, and conserve resources.

This is an interesting and dynamic career choice, as agricultural engineering combines mechanical, civil, electrical, and chemical engineering principles with agricultural principles.
Agricultural engineers have much to do as increasing biological discoveries are adopted to farming practices like on-farm energy production. New uses for agricultural waste are becoming evident and crops are yielding not only food, but new byproducts.

Agricultural engineers design equipment and develop methods for land preparation, planting and harvesting. They use automation, precision, and smart or "intelligence" technologies with new and existing equipment. Sensors are used in combination with microcomputers, controllers, artificial intelligence and other software, which optimizes efficiency, sustainability, and the reliability of food, feed, fibre and fuel for the economy.

        A farmer is involved in the cultivation and management of crops and/or livestock for the purpose of producing food, fiber, or other agricultural products. This is often done on a commercial scale, with the goal of selling these products to consumers or other businesses. Farmers can work on large or small farms, using a variety of techniques and equipment to grow their crops or raise their animals. They must have a deep understanding of the land and the environment in which they work, as well as the science behind crop and animal husbandry.

In addition to growing crops and raising animals, farmers also play an important role in maintaining the health of the land and the ecosystem. They may use sustainable farming practices to minimize the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, and may also take steps to conserve water and other natural resources. Farmers are essential to ensuring that people have access to a safe and reliable food supply, and they work hard to keep up with changing market demands and consumer preferences.

        Hospitals and doctors’ offices depend on the important work of medical lab technicians. These professionals are a critical component of a well-functioning healthcare facility. They work under the supervision of physicians, lab managers or lab technologists to conduct lab tests on specimens. The work they do behind-the-scenes helps doctors detect diseases or illnesses and determine treatment options.

        Though you may not frequently come into contact with a medical lab tech as a patient, it doesn’t mean they don’t play a crucial role in your medical care. If you do encounter a lab tech, they will likely be donning a full lab coat, mask, gloves and goggles while collecting or handling specimens for testing.
        You know medical lab technicians perform lab tests, but what does that actually mean?

Simply put, these tests are chemical analyses of body fluids–such as blood or urine–using a microscope or other advanced lab equipment. These tools help medical lab technicians detect abnormalities or diseases, which are then recorded and reported in computer systems.

      Your job responsibilities will depend upon your food science specialization. For example, if you work in quality assurance, then your job is to monitor food production and ensure that food-making processes are working correctly. You'll also analyze the food to determine the amount of nutrients, sugars, vitamins and fats in them so manufacturers can properly label the food.

If you're working in research, then you'll discover and experiment with different food storage methods and food additives, depending on your assignment. If research isn't interesting to you, then you can work in development and focus on making and improving existing food products.

As a processing food scientist, you'll work on techniques like canning, drying, evaporation, blanching, baking and pasteurization. Finally, as a regulatory food scientist, you'll go around enforcing food regulations for the government or making sure that your food industry employer is following regulations.
You won't need a state-issued license to work as a food scientist. If you job is centered at a farm in growing crops, you may want to seek voluntary certification from the American Society of Agronomy. Certifications offered include certified crop adviser, certified professional agronomist and certified professional soil scientist
