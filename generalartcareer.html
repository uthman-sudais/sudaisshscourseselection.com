            A lawyer is trained in the practice of law and provides legal advice and representation to clients. Lawyers typically have a degree in law from a recognized law school and must pass a state bar exam in order to practice law. They may specialize in a particular area of law such as corporate law, criminal law, intellectual property law, or family law, among others. Lawyers may work in a variety of settings including law firms, government agencies, corporations, or as solo practitioners.
    
    The primary responsibilities of a lawyer include providing legal advice to clients, representing clients in court, drafting legal documents such as contracts and wills, negotiating on behalf of clients, and conducting legal research. Lawyers must also maintain a high level of ethical conduct in their professional practice, as they are bound by a code of ethics that requires them to act in the best interests of their clients while upholding the integrity of the legal system.

            A writer creates written works, such as books, articles, scripts, poetry, or any other form of written content. Writing is a form of expression that allows individuals to communicate their thoughts, ideas, and emotions to an audience through the written word. Writers use their imagination and creativity to develop characters, plots, and themes that engage readers and captivate their attention.

Being a writer requires discipline, dedication, and a passion for writing. Writers often spend hours or even days crafting their work, carefully choosing each word and sentence to convey their message effectively. They must have a strong command of language, grammar, and syntax, as well as the ability to research and organize information. Writers can work in a variety of fields, including journalism, advertising, publishing, and entertainment, and their work can have a significant impact on the world by informing, inspiring, or entertaining audiences.

          Journalists research, write, edit, proofread and file news stories, features and articles. Their pieces are used on television and radio or within magazines, journals and newspapers, in print and online.
          Journalists write and assemble together news stories that will interest their audience. By gathering together a number of different sources and ensuring that all the arguments are represented, they keep their audience abreast of events in their world.
          Many journalists work freelance. However, to do so you will need a network of industry contacts, the ability to propose strong pitches and a reputation for reliability.

Journalism graduate jobs are advertised online, in Campaign , Press Gazette , Broadcast and The Bookseller . Many jobs receive little advertising, so networking, internships and speculative applications (including samples of published work) are advisable. Use The Writers' & Artists' Yearbook to find contact details and other information about a wide range of newspapers and magazines

          A librarian is responsible for organizing, managing, and providing access to information resources in a library. They are responsible for selecting and acquiring books, journals, databases, and other materials for the library's collection, as well as cataloging and classifying them for easy retrieval by library users.

Actors use their talents to bring characters to life and create an emotional connection with their audience. They work with directors, writers, and other performers to develop and refine their performances.

Actors may work in a variety of settings, including theater, film, television, and radio. Some actors work exclusively in one medium, while others work across multiple mediums. They may also work on stage productions, commercials, or voiceovers for animated films or video games. Acting requires a combination of talent, training, and experience, as well as a willingness to work long and irregular hours.
Actors play a crucial role in the entertainment industry, as they are responsible for bringing stories and characters to life. They use their talents to create compelling performances that engage audiences and help to transport them to different worlds. Actors have the ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in their audiences, from laughter to tears, and can help to shape the way that people view the world around them.

      As an General Art teacher, you teach students about topics like microeconomics, macroeconomics, and the math of economics. In this role, you may prepare a lesson plan, deliver lectures to your class, and grade assignments. Since economics is a changing field, you must remain current with new developments. Many economics teachers work at colleges or universities, though it is possible to find positions in high schools and other educational areas. Colleges usually advertise this job with a title like professor instead of teacher. Employers may ask you to participate in other school activities, such as supervising students during field trips, overseeing a club, or helping manage emergency drills
      The primary qualifications for becoming an economics teacher include a college degree in a relevant area, such as economics or finance. The degree you need depends on where you plan to work, but most colleges prefer applicants who have a master's degree or a doctorate in economics. If you want to teach at the high school level, you need a license to teach. Industry experience is useful if you want to teach in a specific area, so some people become teachers later in their careers.

        A musician is a person who plays a musical instrument or sings, either as a profession or as a hobby. Musicians create, perform, and interpret music in various genres, such as classical, jazz, pop, rock, hip-hop, and others. They may perform solo or in ensemble settings, such as orchestras, bands, choirs, or chamber groups. Some musicians also compose original music, write songs, or arrange existing music. Some musicians may also teach music to others, either privately or in educational institutions.

The role of a musician varies widely and can encompass many different skills and activities, but the common thread is a love of music and a desire to bring it to life.
A musician’s passion is to play music. They spend a significant amount of time learning, practicing, and perfecting their musical abilities so as to become professionals within the music world, or to teach music to others. Musicians may perform as solo artists, in bands, ensembles, choirs, and orchestras either in front of live audiences, or in recording studios.

        Television and radio presenters work in a highly competitive industry, where long hours, excellent communication skills and the drive to succeed are required.
        A broadcast presenter is the face or voice of programmes broadcast via television, radio and the internet. You'll work on a variety of platforms including national, regional, satellite and cable television, local and national radio and online.

Your role is to entertain and inform an audience by presenting information or entertainment in an accessible and attractive way. You'll introduce, host (or co-host) a programme, create links between items, introduce and interview guests and interact with the audience. The exact nature of the job may vary according to a programme's subject matter, for example if it covers news, weather, sport, music or lifestyle.

Broadcasters are expected to uphold certain legal standards in their research methods and material.
You don't need a degree to become a broadcast presenter as employers tend to look more for experience and practical skills. Postgraduate courses are available at a number of institutions across Ireland and Northern Ireland, however gathering as much practical experience as possible in a broadcasting environment is vital

        A blogger writes content on a blog, which is an online platform for publishing articles, stories, and other forms of written expression. Bloggers create content on a regular basis, usually centered around a particular theme or topic, and share their perspectives, opinions, experiences, and insights with their readers. Blogs can cover a wide range of subjects, from personal stories and lifestyle tips to news, politics, technology, and entertainment.

Blogging has become increasingly popular in recent years as more people turn to the internet for information and entertainment. Many bloggers have built large audiences and gained influence through their writing, and some have even turned their blogs into full-time careers. While anyone can start a blog, successful bloggers typically have strong writing skills, a clear voice and style, and a commitment to consistently creating engaging and informative content.
With the rise of social media and digital platforms, bloggers have become even more influential, using their online presence to influence public opinion, challenge established ideas, and promote new ones.

      Secretaries and administrators play a supportive role in organisations where they are employed to undertake a variety of administrative tasks.
      Secretaries and administrators help to keep an organisation running smoothly, taking care of the administrative and organisational tasks that make the organisation function. The job title ‘administrator’ and ‘secretary’ can be used interchangeably to describe the same role, or ‘secretary’ can be another, more old-fashioned name for a personal assistant or executive assistant. Read our other job description to learn about personal assistant skills and how the role differs from that of a secretary.
      However, if you wish to specialise in an administrative role, career progression can come from taking on more senior administrative positions; what these are exactly will differ according to the organisation. In some, you might become a senior administrator or team leader; in others, a personal or executive assistant ; in still more, an office manager
