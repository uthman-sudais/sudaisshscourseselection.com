          <h2>About General Agriculture</h2>
          <p>
            General Agricultural Sciences should be seriously considered by students desiring programs of study not currently available in any other agricultural subject matter department (such as those involving a minor in communications, recreation, or environmental studies in agriculture); students wishing to pursue two or more areas of specialization (such as students who are returning to farms or ranches and who need substantial background, for example, in animal science, crops, and agricultural business management); students preparing for leadership positions in agriculture that require excellent communication and leadership skills as well as breadth of agricultural background such as agriculture teachers, lobbyists, commodity liaison persons or extension staff

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>
          <p>
            Core subjects are the subject which are compulsary and common among all the courses being offered in all SHS in Ghana.The core subject are only four namely: 
           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in Visual Art </h3>
           <h5>1.Forestry </h5>
          <p>
            Forests play a major role in the maintenance of environmental quality through their productive functions which yield direct and indirect benefits. The direct benefits include timber, fuelwood, bamboo and rattan, canes, sponges, medicinal plants, wildlife, mushroom and snails. The indirect benefits, though very vital, are not fully appreciated. They include erosion control, moderation of climate, protection of water bodies, supply of oxygen and purification of air. In addition to the above benefits, the forest estate of Ghana contributes immensely to the socio-economic development of the country. Timber is the fourth source of foreign exchange earner in Ghana, whilst fuelwood, bush meat, medicinal plants and other forest products contribute significantly to the livelihood of most Ghanaians.
Inspite of these benefits, the rate of exploitation of the forest resources has out-paced conservation measures resulting in deforestation, destruction of wildlife and environmental degradation. There is therefore an urgent need to take appropriate measures to stop the depletion and degradation of forest resources in the country.
          </p>
          <h5>2.Chemistry</h5>
           <p>
            chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes.
            Chemistry also is concerned with the utilization of natural substances and the creation of artificial ones. Cooking, fermentation, glass making, and metallurgy are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization.
            Most of the materials that occur on Earth, such as wood, coal, minerals, or air, are mixtures of many different and distinct chemical substances. Each pure chemical substance (e.g., oxygen, iron, or water) has a characteristic set of properties that gives it its chemical identity.
          </p>
          <h5>3.General Agricultural</h5>       
          <p>
            The importance of agriculture in the national economy is well recognised in terms of food production, income generation and employment opportunities. However, the potential of agriculture in Ghana is marginally utilised. Government policy is therefore to modernise the agricultural sector in such a way as to make Ghana an agro-industrialized country leading to the rural transformation of the country. The policy aims at improving the productivity of small-scale producers while actively promoting the emergence of medium and large-scale agricultural enterprises.
In line with government policy, the Ministry of Education has the responsibility to review agricultural education to ensure the development of well-trained agricultural work-force including managers and specialists of various kinds. There is the need for a broad-based training in agriculture to equip agricultural students with scientific, vocational and technological competencies to enable them fit into various sectors of agriculture. The agricultural training offered at the SHS level and particularly in the study of General Agriculture, lays the foundation for further work in agriculture at the tertiary level.
          </p>
          <h5>4.Physics</h5>   
          <p>
            Physics, as a discipline, deals with the nature of matter and energy, their interactions and measurements. The study of Physics has had, and continues to have, a big impact on the world community. The ideas, skills and attitudes derived from the study of physics are being widely applied in various scientific and technological developments. As an example, development in renewable energy is serving the world profoundly and it is hoped that it will become more available in Ghana to complement other sources for meeting the energy needs of the country. The specific example of renewable energy is solar, that transforms in appropriate forms such as electrical energy for operating simple equipment, and machinery, and for domestic use. The principles and applications of physics cut across the various spectrum of everyday life activities like walking, lifting objects, seeing and taking photographs
          </p>
          <h5>5.Fishery </h5>  
          <p>
            Fisheries is important to the economic development of this nation and it is the single most dominant economic activity in the coastal zone and along the shores of the Volta Lake, major rivers and other water bodies. Fishery resources provide a reliable source of animal protein, and it is a major non-traditional export commodity with significant annual earnings. The fisheries sector is also important, because about 10% of Ghana’s population is dependent on fisheries resources for their livelihood. It is a key player in poverty reduction, and contributes 5% of Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 3% of National GDP. Because of its importance, the teaching of fisheries has been given prominence in the educational system of the country.
The development of a syllabus in fisheries, as an elective subject at the pre-tertiary level, seeks to generate the learners‟ interest in fisheries at an early age and equip them with the basic knowledge in entrepreneurial skills that will enable them to pursue fisheries-related vocations. The study of fisheries helps the student to combine general knowledge with practical-oriented skills. It also helps to lay the foundation for further training in the subject at the tertiary level
          </p>
          <h5>6.Elective ICT </h5>  
          <p>
            This course is designed to provide advanced skills in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Senior High School (SHS) students. It is expected that the knowledge and skills gained in this course will prepare students to pursue ICT courses in years ahead and provide them with the basic skills needed for the ICT job market. The syllabus covers selected topics in ICT which offer hands-on activities to help students acquire the required ICT skills.
            scope of content This syllabus has been planned at a higher content level than the ICT content at the Core ICT level. This has been done to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the job market and for pursuing further ICT course. The themes of this course are as follows:
Information and Communications Technology Hardware Introduction to software development PC Hardware Maintenance and Software Installation Desktop Publishing Software and its functionality Word Processing Spreadsheet Introduction to Data Processing Systems Introduction to Programming Basic Networking Data Communications Introduction to Educational Technology
