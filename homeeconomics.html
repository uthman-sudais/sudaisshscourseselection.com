          <h2>About Home Economics </h2>
          <p>
            Home Economics, also known as family and consumer science, is a subject concerning cooking, nutrition, housekeeping, personal finance, personal wellness, and consumer issues. in the past, it was mainly just about cooking and housework.

            Home Economics courses are offered around the world and across multiple educational levels. Historically, the purpose of these courses was to professionalize housework, to provide intellectual fulfillment for women, and to emphasize the value of "women's work" in society and prepare them for traditional gender roles

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>
          <p>
            Core subjects are the subject which are compulsary and common among all the courses being offered in all SHS in Ghana.The core subject are only four namely: 
           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in Home Economics </h3>
           <h5>1.Food And Nutrition </h5>
          <p>
            Home Economics consists of three subjects: Food and Nutrition, Clothing and Textiles, and Management In-Living. The subjects of Home Economics emphasize the study of the physical, emotional, intellectual and social needs of the individual, the family and society. The welfare of the individual, the family and society is therefore the primary concern in Home Economics. This concern is manifested by assisting the student to acquire skills that he/she would need to be able to improve the quality and meaning of life in a changing society.
Without good food, an individual would not be able to function well in all spheres of life. It is therefore important that students are exposed to ways of selecting and cooking wholesome food for themselves and others. In addition, Food and Nutrition as a vocational subject, prepares students for the world of work
          </p>
          <h5>2.Biology</h5>
           <p>
            Biology is a natural science discipline that studies living things. It is a very large and broad field due to the wide variety of life found on Earth, so individual biologists normally focus on specific fields. These fields are either categorized by the scale of life or by the types of organisms studied.
            For example, the scale of biology can cover everything from genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology – studying the molecules of life inside our cells and how they help us function – to cell biology which focuses on the basic unit of life.
            Biology is also a foundation for other biology-based professions such as medicine, nursing and allied health, pharmacy and pharmacology, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.
 
          </p>
          <h5>3.Economics</h5>       
          <p>
            Economics is the practical and theoretical science of the production and distribution of wealth. It is based around the system of the production, buying and selling of goods and services.

            As a social science it is primarily concerned with the behaviour and relationships of people and societies and economics is applied to the real world to study and analyse the activities and interaction between people, markets and governments.
            
            Although there are various subdivisions of economics, the two main areas of study are microeconomics and macroeconomics
            It has grown considerably as a field and now incorporates a number of other subjects, including sociology, geography, law and several others to develop our collective understanding of the economic systems that exist today.    </p>
          <h5>4.General knowledge in Art</h5>   
          <p>
            General Knowledge in Art (GKA) is a composite subject made up of Art History, Appreciation and general art concepts. These subjects are teased out from all the Visual Arts subjects studied at the Senior High School (SHS) level. The rationale is to provide the student of visual art broad based knowledge and skills in the theory and practice of visual art. The theory component of GKA is to broaden the student‟s scope of vocabulary and to equip him/her with the requisite communication skills that would enable him/her to talk knowledgeably in the subject. The practical component has been designed to reinforce the skills that the visual art student learns in the individual elective subjects of study. Collectively, the objective is to predispose the senior high school student to develop love for the appreciation of the cultural and aesthetic values of Ghanaian arts. Love for the cultural and aesthetic values has the capacity to reinforce the development of the affective domains of learning and to encourage development of patriotism, national pride and self esteem in students.

            
          </p>
          <h5>5.Clothing And Textiles </h5>  
          <p>
            A major objective of the Ghanaian educational system is to equip individuals with employable skills to enable them contribute meaningfully towards the development of the nation. Consequently, the main aim of teaching Clothing and Textiles is to train students to acquire knowledge and skills in clothing production and management. Thus the Clothing and Textiles Syllabus aims at providing students with experiences that will develop their competences in textiles selection and use, and clothing production and management
          </p>
          <h5>5.Elective ICT </h5>  
          <p>
            This course is designed to provide advanced skills in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for Senior High School (SHS) students. It is expected that the knowledge and skills gained in this course will prepare students to pursue ICT courses in years ahead and provide them with the basic skills needed for the ICT job market. The syllabus covers selected topics in ICT which offer hands-on activities to help students acquire the required ICT skills.
            scope of content This syllabus has been planned at a higher content level than the ICT content at the Core ICT level. This has been done to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the job market and for pursuing further ICT course. The themes of this course are as follows:
Information and Communications Technology Hardware Introduction to software development PC Hardware Maintenance and Software Installation Desktop Publishing Software and its functionality Word Processing Spreadsheet Introduction to Data Processing Systems Introduction to Programming Basic Networking Data Communications Introduction to Educational Technology

          </p>
          <h5>6.Management In Living </h5>  
          <p>
            Management-In-Living deals with ways for managing human and non-human resources to achieve the quality of life desired by individuals, families and society. The subject looks at demands such as values, goals, events and resources that motivate resource utilization
            Management in Living is one of the three subject areas of Home Economics. The other areas are Foods and Nutrition, and Clothing and Textiles. The subjects of Home Economics emphasize the study of the physical, emotional, intellectual and social needs of the individual, the family and the society. The welfare of the individual, the family and the society is therefore the primary concern of Home Economics. This concern is manifested by assisting the student to acquire skills that he/she would need to be able to deal creatively with the relevant problems of a changing society to improve the quality and meaning of life.
          </p>
          <h5>7.Chemistry </h5>  
          <p>
            chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes.
            Chemistry also is concerned with the utilization of natural substances and the creation of artificial ones. Cooking, fermentation, glass making, and metallurgy are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization.
            Most of the materials that occur on Earth, such as wood, coal, minerals, or air, are mixtures of many different and distinct chemical substances. Each pure chemical substance (e.g., oxygen, iron, or water) has a characteristic set of properties that gives it its chemical identity.
