        A science teacher’s job is teaching science to his students. A person who decides to become a science teacher may have many career options available to him. He may decide to work in an elementary or middle school to teach a range of subjects, including science. If he’d like to focus on a particular science subject, however, he may opt to teach high school instead. Some aspiring science teachers even choose to earn advanced degrees that allow them to pursue careers as college professors.
        Science instructors teach important science concepts. They may cover such basic science subjects as biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science as well as a full range of other subjects. The subjects a science teacher covers may vary, depending on such factors as where he teaches and the age of the students he’s instructing. Often, science instruction includes not only lecturing or the presentation of key concepts, but also hands-on work and experimentation.

        Forensic scientists use analytical and scientific techniques to examine evidence from crimes and prepare legal statements for court cases.
        Forensic scientists analyse evidence from crime scenes and create detailed scientific reports for legal proceedings. They spend much time in laboratories examining traces of evidence; their findings can then be used to associate or disassociate suspects with victims or crime scenes. They may also spend time in court and in offices writing reports. Occasionally they may need to visit crime scenes.
        To become a forensic scientist, you need a degree in forensic science or another science subject. Some employers may have specific degree requirements, so check carefully – for example, not all science-based subjects guarantee entry into the profession, and not all forensic science degrees are accredited by the Chartered Society of Forensic Science.

        A pharmacist is a healthcare professional who is specifically trained to store, handle, prepare, and dispense various medications. 

They play an essential role in educating patients about using or administering their medications. Likewise, they serve as a “final check” to ensure that doses are correct and that a patient will not experience negative or harmful drug interactions. 
Pharmacists typically work in pharmacies. While most people think of a corner store like CVS, Duane Reade, or RiteAid when they hear the word “pharmacy,” pharmacies can be found in many different locations, and pharmacists’ specific duties can vary significantly depending on their work setting.
Simply put, anywhere that a patient might need medication prepared or distributed is likely to have a pharmacist on staff.
pharmacists work in healthcare settings such as clinics, hospitals, or other locations. Clinical pharmacists typically spend a significant amount of time providing direct care to patients, recommending medications, and overseeing or adjusting dosages as necessary throughout treatment

        Hospitals and doctors’ offices depend on the important work of medical lab technicians. These professionals are a critical component of a well-functioning healthcare facility. They work under the supervision of physicians, lab managers or lab technologists to conduct lab tests on specimens. The work they do behind-the-scenes helps doctors detect diseases or illnesses and determine treatment options.

        Though you may not frequently come into contact with a medical lab tech as a patient, it doesn’t mean they don’t play a crucial role in your medical care. If you do encounter a lab tech, they will likely be donning a full lab coat, mask, gloves and goggles while collecting or handling specimens for testing.
        You know medical lab technicians perform lab tests, but what does that actually mean?

Simply put, these tests are chemical analyses of body fluids–such as blood or urine–using a microscope or other advanced lab equipment. These tools help medical lab technicians detect abnormalities or diseases, which are then recorded and reported in computer systems.

      Biologists study humans, plants, animals, and the environments in which they live. They may conduct their studies--human medical research, plant research, animal research, environmental system research--at the cellular level or the ecosystem level or anywhere in between. Biologists are students of the world, interested in learning from every facet of life. Although this scope may seem overwhelming, in practice, biologists specialize in discrete areas that they feel drawn to. Biologists’ daily activities are driven by their area of specialization. Marine biologists study marine populations and physiology, working off boats, at oceanography centers, at aquariums, and at a variety of coastal sites. Biochemists spend most of their day in a laboratory analyzing tissue samples and designing and carrying out research projects to test new hypotheses. Agricultural scientists analyze crop yields produced from different soils, fertilizers, or chemicals. Biologists study life to uncover its secrets and to find ways to solve problems, such as finding a cure for a disease.  Biologists generally love what they do.
