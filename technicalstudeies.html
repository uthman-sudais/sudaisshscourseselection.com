            However, with some of the abilities learned in these classes, any job route can be pursued and successful.
          </p>

          <h3> Core subjects offered in SHS in Ghana </h3>
          <p>
            Core subjects are the subject which are compulsary and common among all the courses being offered in all SHS in Ghana.The core subject are only four namely: 
           </p>
           <h5> Intergrated Science</h5>
           <h5> English Language</h5>
           <h5> Social Studies</h5>
           <h5> Core Mathematics</h5>

           <h3> Elective subjects offered in General Science  </h3>
           <h5>1.Physics</h5>
          <p>
            Physics is often described as the study of matter and energy. It is concerned with how matter and energy relate to each other, and how they affect each other over time and through space. Physicists ask the fundamental questions: How did the universe begin? How and of what is it made? How does it change? What rules govern its behavior
            The study of physics has had and continues to have,a big impact on the world community.The idea,skills and attribute derived from the study of physics are being widely applied in varoius scientific and technological develpment 
             As an example ,development in renewable energy is serving the world profoundly and it is hoped that it will become more available in Ghana to complement other sources for meeting the energy needs of the country.
             The principles and application of physics cut across the varoius spectrum of everyday life activities like walking, lifting, seeing and taking photographs 
          </p>
          <h5>2.Chemistry</h5>
           <p>
            chemistry, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes.
            Chemistry also is concerned with the utilization of natural substances and the creation of artificial ones. Cooking, fermentation, glass making, and metallurgy are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization.
            Most of the materials that occur on Earth, such as wood, coal, minerals, or air, are mixtures of many different and distinct chemical substances. Each pure chemical substance (e.g., oxygen, iron, or water) has a characteristic set of properties that gives it its chemical identity.
          </p>
          <h5>3.WoodWork</h5>       
          <p>
            Woodwork provides knowledge and skills in the art and craft of woodworking and further equips the learner with the necessary basic skills for work in the wood-based industry. This syllabus is an improved version of the earlier syllabus. Besides other important changes, the syllabus includes knowledge of technical drawing and designing, and the methods and principles of construction. Knowledge acquired in this subject at Senior High School level will be helpful for students who wish to proceed to tertiary education. Students who would want to enter the world of work immediately after completing SHS will require only a short period of further training to polish up for gainful employment in industry.
          </p>
          <h5>4.Elective Mathematics</h5>   
          <p>
           Elective Mathematics at the Senior High School buils on the Core Mathematics Of Sebior High School.
           Elective Maths is done in addition to Core Maths which is required for all students. The goal for teaching the subject is to equip students who would pursue further studies in fields that require additional mathematics with the requisite mathematical knowledge and facility.

           It covers most of the topics in A-level mathematics papers from Cambridge though it is a little easier.
           
           On the WASSCE examination papers, it is called Further Mathematics Elective
           These include the skill of working with mathematical information, as well as the ability to think logically and independently, consider accuracy, model situations mathematically, analyse results and reflect on findings. 
          </p>
          <h5>5.Metal Work </h5>  
          <p>
            Metalwork is a subject that deals with basic elements of Mechanical Engineering. The skills acquired in the subject provide the foundation for developing basic engineering solutions to simple problems in the home, school and community. The subject therefore offers the student the chance to acquire valuable skills that open up a wide range of opportunities for employment and productive work.
          </p>
          <h5>6.Applied Electricals </h5>  
          <p>
            The course offers enough knowledge and skills for students who would want to get into Electrical/Electronics vocations after completing Senior High School. The course also offers valuable foundation for higher professional studies at the tertiary level of education.
            Applied Electricity provides students with broad understanding of the technology of the manufacture, installation, maintenance and repairs of domestic and industrial equipment using electrical and test apparatus correctly and safely. It is expected that more students will enrol in this course to enable the country to develop the envisaged large corps of electrical and electronic engineers for the country’s growing industries
          
          </p>
          <h5>6.Building Construction Technology</h5>  
          <p>
            The Building Construction course is based on knowledge, skills and processes already acquired at the JHS Basic Design and Technology programme. The course equips students with more knowledge, skills and processes to enable them fit into middle level manpower positions in the Building and allied Industries.
            The course has been designed in such a way as to cater for the needs of students who wish to go on for further education as well as those who wish to exit the school system after SHS 3. For students who wish to go on to higher levels of education and training in the University, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education and Technology, the course provides adequate knowledge and skills for success at such levels. Students who wish to terminate their course at SHS 3 would also have had adequate level of skills and knowledge of materials, processes and procedures for building and construction that will help them get into employment.

        </p>
        <h5>7.Welding</h5>
          <p>
            This course  training is designed as a combination of hands-on welding experience and classroom theory. Our welding courses account for many individual skill levels and are a great way to learn to weld for all levels of welding experience. Welding training students may progress to professional welders or use welding as part of their hobby.

Welding Programs and Skills Training courses allow students to develop a working knowledge of welding techniques, equipment setup, and operations. Instruction is available for Gas Metal Arc Welding, Flux Core Arc Welding, Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, and Shielded Metal Arc Welding processes. Our welding courses are designed to serve the needs of many individual skill levels, from the beginner to the advanced welder. Welding is a skill to be developed, and at LWT we focus on individual practice to attain that skill
          </p>
          <h5>8.Mechanical Engineering</h5>
          <p>
            Mechanical engineers build the world around us. From the tiniest nanotechnology, through to cars and buildings, to airplanes and space stations, mechanical engineers are responsible for the design and development of most things.

Studying mechanical engineering is a combination of science, maths, and computing. It’s the study of machinery, and how to manufacture and maintain it at all levels. It’s a limitless subject, which plays a role in everything from vehicles to cities, energy to artificial intelligence, military to healthcare, and everything in between.
Other subjects that will support an application for mechanical engineering include further maths, design technology, computing, product design, and the other sciences. When it comes to your skills and extracurricular activities, universities will be looking for practicality, attention to detail, proficiency with technology, computing, and numeracy.


          </p>
          <h5>9.General Textiles</h5>
          <p>
            The Textiles Subject is based on the Basic Design and Technology course at the Basic Education level. Students offering a course in Visual Art should have acquired satisfactory literacy and numeracy skills including basic skills in drawing and designing, as well as knowledge in integrated science and social studies at the Junior High School level.
            Textiles, a component of visual art, embraces activities that result in two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms. A society achieves its significance through its production in the visual arts. We as a people are identified through our art works. To develop pride and patriotism in our young people, it is important that our young people acquire love for the cultural and aesthetic values in textiles. The competitive nature of the textiles industry globally has resulted in the suppression and near collapse of our textiles industry. There is the need to promote and diversify our indigenous textiles industry. The textiles syllabus therefore is structured and geared towards the diversification of the industry in order to generate more jobs and alleviate poverty.
          </p>
          <h5>10.Plumbering craft</h5>
          <p> 
            Plumbing is the system of pipes, tanks, fittings, and other apparatus required for the water supply, heating, and sanitation in a building. Plumbers work to maintain and install plumbing systems.

Students in this plumbing technology program learn how to design, install, and repair residential and commercial plumbing systems and hydronic heating systems. Some of the skills acquired are joining different types of piping materials, reading blueprints, and installing and repairing boilers, plumbing fixtures, faucets, and water heaters.

Plumbers install, repair, and maintain systems for transporting water, sewage, and gas. Plumbers who work for construction companies hook up and install a building’s plumbing and water systems to the available municipal or other water supply, adhering to codes and using a variety of tools and measurements to ensure accuracy. Those who work for plumbing repair companies visit homes and businesses to repair water, sewer, and plumbing systems, fix sinks or toilets, or replace worn or broken pipes.
